          </h3>
          <p class="ourStory__text">
            It all started in 2005 with a vision to bring the perfect balance of flavor, freshness, and warmth to every meal. Welcome to Blue Heron, a place where tradition meets innovation, founded by Grace Kim, whose passion for food has always been rooted in a deep appreciation for the art of handmade sandwiches. 
            <br> <br> Grace spent years perfecting her craft, drawing inspiration from family recipes and her love for fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Each sandwich is carefully crafted with a commitment to quality, offering a taste that feels both nostalgic and entirely new. From the very beginning, Blue Heron has been more than just a restaurantâ€”it's a community hub where people can come together, enjoy hearty meals, and make memories that last a lifetime.
            <br> <br> At Blue Heron, every bite tells a story. We invite you to be a part of ours.

            </h3>
            <p class="ourStory__text">
            Grace Kim is the owner of the household Magnolia establishment, Blue Heron. She says, "Since 2005, we have always tried our best to allow customers to make Blue Heron feel like home, not just a place to eat. Being in the hear of Magnolia, there are many customers who stop by for a bite to eat and also those who have been coming in for many years. One thing I want all of my customers to feel when they walk in, is a sense of comfort and family. From the neighborhood regulars to the fisherman that visit from afar, I want all of them to come in knowing that they're always welcome at Blue Heron."
